# Projects
For **repo-level** requirements and instructions, see primary [README](../README.md).

This directory consists of Tessel projects - collections of scripts that share common dependencies. While only one sketch can be uploaded to the Tessel at a time, each project can be treated as a separate build (code package that will be deployed to the Tessel).

1. [Basics](./01_Basics/): A few examples for new Tesselators
2. [Packages](./02_Packages/): Learn how Tessel builds work
3. [Modules](./03_Modules/):
4. [PrivateData](./04_PrivateData/): Keep your private data safe
5. [Connecting](./05_Connecting/): Get your Tessel online
6. [WebServices](./06_WebServices):

## Instructions
Refer to each project's README. Each example builds on the previous sketch's material.
