// Tessel is a micro-controller programmed in Javascript.
//
// Javascript is an interpreted programming language most often associated with the Web.
// It is one of the three core Web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS).
//
// Javascript is increasingly used in environments that are not web-based.
//
// Tessel's code execution environment is Node.js
// To learn more about Node.js: https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html


// The most simple program prints something and exits.
console.log("\nHello Tessel\n")

// This isn't necessary, but calling `return` in the primary scope
// will terminate the program immediately.
return
