# 01_Basics
The first project is simple. Read through each script and run them on the Tessel using the [CLI](https://github.com/tessel/t1-docs/blob/master/cli.md).
```
# command line
tessel run 01_Start.js
```
- Note that `tessel run` runs the script on the tessel, while `tessel push` deploys it to the Tessel. To explore the CLI, try `tessel --help`
